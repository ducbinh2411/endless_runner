- I tried to rename the folder "Debt Runner Prototype" to "Debt Runner Final Version" but it did not work. Anyway, the file was pushed in Github is the final version and it should be good to run.
- In my game, I used some resourses from Unity asset and some from this course (Jr Programmer Pathway, Create with Code: Sound and Effects)
